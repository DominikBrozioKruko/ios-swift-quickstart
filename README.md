## Installation Instructions

### Log into your Capella Free-Tier account

A listing of operational clusters should appear. Click on your demo-cluster in the list. This should bring up the Home page for your cluster.

### Create a new App Service

On the Home tab under the **Explore your cluster** section, find the section **Try App Services** and click on the link **Deploy App Services**.

On the App Services page, click the **Create App Service** button. The Create App Services page should appear.

On the Create App Services page:

- Enter a name for your app service (e.g. `demo-app-service`)
- Under the **Linked Cluster** section, select your demo-cluster from the drop-down list
- Click the **Create App Service** button

> It may take between 5 and 25 minutes for the new App Service to be created.

### Create a new App Endpoint

Once the App Service is created and its status is listed as `Healthy`, click on the App Service name you just created.

On the App Endpoints screen, click the **Create App Endpoint** button.

On the Create App Endpoint page:

- Enter a name (e.g. `hotels`) in the **App Endpoint Name** field
- For **Bucket**, select `travel-sample`
- For **Scope**, select `inventory`

Under **Choose collections to link**:

- Enable the `hotel` collection by switching the Link toggle to On

Click the **Create App Endpoint** button. You‚Äôll be redirected to the App Endpoints list.

### Set up App Endpoint security

Click on the newly created endpoint (e.g. `hotels`) to view the App Endpoint details.

On the **Security** tab:

- If a message appears stating that the App Endpoint is paused, click the **Resume app endpoint** link  
  > This may take a few seconds.

We will use the default access control and data validation scripts.

Click on the **App Users** tab in the left-hand navigation menu.

Click the **Create App User** button.

On the Create App User page:

- Enter a username and password for the new user  
  *(Be sure to save these credentials ‚Äî you‚Äôll need them for the app configuration)*

Under **Assign Channels**:

- Locate the `hotel` collection under **Linked Collections**
- Enter the Admin Channel name `hotel` and hit the Enter key  
  > It should appear as a chip/tag.

Click the **Create App User** button.

### Get the App Endpoint URL

Click on the **Connect** tab in the navigation header.

The **Connect** page will appear, showing the Public Connection string.

- Click the **copy icon** next to the URL to copy the App Endpoint URL to your clipboard  
  > You‚Äôll need this in the app configuration file.

### Pull down the code

Use the terminal to clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DominikBrozioKruko/ios-swift-quickstart

### Open the project in Xcode

- Navigate to the `ios-swift-quickstart` folder  
- Double-click the `ios-swift-quickstart.xcodeproj` file  
  > This should launch Xcode with the project loaded

### Configure the app

Inside the Project Navigator in Xcode:

- Locate the `Config.swift` file inside the `ios-swift-quickstart` folder
- Open the file and provide the following configuration values:

  - **Remote Capella endpoint URL** ‚Äì Paste the URL copied from the Connect page  
  - **Authentication / Username** ‚Äì Enter the App User username  
  - **Authentication / Password** ‚Äì Enter the App User password

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

If you do not fill out the configuration file, the app **will not sync** with your Capella cluster or endpoint.
